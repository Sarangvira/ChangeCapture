# ChangeCapture
captured changes from postgres database and stream them into kafka

# Overview
Python script is designed to generate simulated financial transactions and insert them into a PostgreSQL database. It's particularly useful for setting up a test environment for Change Data Capture (CDC) with Debezium. The script uses the faker library to create realistic, yet fictitious, transaction data and inserts it into a PostgreSQL table.
